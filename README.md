Here I will leave the url link to the code and a build of my games that I made so far in Unreal Engine 5. Most of the games were done with help of a course and they showcase all my learnings and expirence with Unreal. Most of the games have been done with a mix of Bluprints and C++ code.

The first game is called Crypt Raider and its a game where the player needs to use a grab mechanic to get treasure. It showcases how a player can grab things use triggers and also the level shows the use of lighting and its variation.

The second game is called Quick Draw and its a simple 2D game. This game is just a samurai stand off were you need to click the butoon at the right time.

The third is called Simple Shooter this game is a third person shooter where I showcase how to use and blend animations in unreal. This game is simple where the player can shoot, move and jump. Also the enemies follow the player if in line of site. The follow the player using a nav mesh and start shooting when close.

Fourth game is a game about a tank that need to destroy all the turrets called ToonTanks. This game mainly shows all the experience with blueprints and programming that I have learned in Unreal. Plus it show clean and scalable code.

The last game is a simple shoot marble game that drops barrels. This game is mainly made with blueprint.

I hope this shows my experience that I have with the Unreal Engine plus my experience with C++ towards programming games.
